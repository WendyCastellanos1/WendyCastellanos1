- 👋 Hi, I’m @WendyCastellanos1
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack java development, or backend development, or just database development! Java or C#, any rdbms, but not fancy front-end!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker and containerization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate!
- 📫 How to reach me: wendy.castellanos1@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun facts: I love coding, but I also enjoy skateboarding and surfing a few times a week. These outdoor board sports are refreshing and healthy! I am a graduate of UC San Diego.
